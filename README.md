## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

One of the main things that I learned on with this challenge was how to make use of the "content" property in css. Using this attribute you can serve the user with the relevant media depending on the device he is viewing from. This way you can have different designs for different screensizes.

```css
img {
  content: ulr(image.jpg);
}
```
